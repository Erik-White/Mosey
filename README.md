# Mosey
An all-in-one imaging and analysis tool for measuring microorganism colony growth

### Image scanning
Mosey will run a set of scanners at specified intervals to produce a timeline of cell-culture plate images. At the end of the colony growth period these images are collated for analysis

### Image analysis
A full set of statistical data will be generated from the images using [ColonyScanalyser](https://github.com/Erik-White/ColonyScanalyser)
